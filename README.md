# ProgrammingCoursework
The coursework which I did during my Programming 1/2 modules for Newcastle University.

NOTES:
I'd recommend you look at the Programming 2 Project 1 if you'd like to see an example of what I can do, as the previous projects are too basic to show anything other than beginner code.
The Programming 1 Projects 1/2 also don't have any packages, as the specifications said they must both be in the default package.
